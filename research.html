             <!--    <p>
           I have alwa>ys been fascinated by modeling, design, motion planning, and control of Dynamical Systems (DS) in the optimal way possible. 
                    <!--I have been intrigued by the challenges: What if the dynamics of a system in an environment are not fully known? What if the DS is affected by uncertainties (the reason for most of the mission failures)? What if the DS is exposed to off-nominal conditions such as subsystem failures, extremely uncertain environments, etc.? Can we still stabilize the DS and reach the goal? If so, can we provide theoretical stabilities? To this end, I leveraged optimal control theory, data-driven modeling, optimization theory, and probability to answer a few of the above questions. Below, I discuss my research experiences.    </p> -->

                                This work focuses on designing single D-o-F underactuated compliant gripper for grasping irregulat shaped 3D objecs. The kinematic design of the phalanxes of the fingers are synthesized by minimizing the transmission defect using the freudenstein's equations. The first iteration of the design is completed and is being optimized for the second iteration.

                            <h3>Optimal smooth trajectory planning of the series-parallel robotic manipulator using neural networks: Investigating novel neural architectures for smooth trajectories</h3>
                          <!--   <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Lead Researcher</p>-->

                                This work focuses on planning smooth trajectories for an additive manufacturing task using a series-parallel robotic manipulator. I formulated the forward and inverse kinematics using standard closed-loop equations leveraging the parallel nature of the RM. Initially, I formulated the motion planning of additive manufacturing tasks in joint space using cubic splines to establish a benchmark (presented at the INSARM conference). Later, I explored various neural architectures and formulated a new activation function to reduce the peaks of jerk and acceleration. The new motion planning approach yielded a nearly 40% reduction in jerk for the same amount of task time. Currently, I am developing the theoretical basis for the new neural architecture.

                            <h3>Design optimization of novel vertically landing stage recovery approach of the launch vehicle</h3>
                          <!--   <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Lead Researcher</p>-->
                            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Jan 2022 - May 2022 & Sep 2023 - present</p>
                            <p>
                                This work focuses on one-of-a-kind vertical landing stage recovery approaches for the launch vehicle known as the Spear-In-Sand (SIS) recovery approach. Traditional vertical landings require deep engine throttling during descent, often leading to severe combustion instabilities, especially with single or large engines. The SIS approach avoids deep throttling by decelerating the spent stage to a minimal non-zero velocity and body rate, then allowing it to land on a specially prepared sand bed with spear-shaped landing legs. The energy dissipates in the form of penetration and provides anchoring to the stage. I modeled the landing dynamics of this process using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with inspiration from free fall penetrometer tests in the sand in geotechnical engineering. I formulated a black-box function using the FEA with the touchdown state vector as the input and reaction loads and final displacements as the output. Later, I constructed a data-driven model for the black-box function using the Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) and Adaptive Sequential (AS) sampling.

                            </h5>
                            <p> With the data-driven model (or surrogate model), I formulated the re-entry trajectory of the vertical landing stage with three phases: Boost Back Burn Phase, Aero-Braking Phase, and Powered Descent Phase. I coupled the data-driven model and the re-entry trajectory using Multi-Disciplinary Feasible (MDF) architecture with the global objective function of minimizing the reaction loads. The results indicate the feasibility of the landing process. This study culminated in my bachelor's thesis.

                            <h5>Phase-2: Surrogate assisted reliability-based design optimization of vertically landing stage recovery of the launch vehicle using Monte Carlo simulations. </h5>
                            <p> Without the deep throttling of the engine and the unknown recovery conditions, the touchdown state vector is highly susceptible to uncertainties from various sources. After my bachelor's, I continued to work on this problem. I incorporated the uncertainties into the touchdown state vector and computed the optimal state vector subjected to safety chance constraints, minimizing the reaction loads. I formulated this problem as a reliability-based design optimization problem. In the process, a modified algorithm is presented to decrease the computation time for solving the RBDO problem (journal manuscript in progress). Finally, the results show that the recovery method is feasible in presence of uncertainties.</p>
                            <p> Currently, I am working on the stochastic optimal control of the landing stage from the atmospheric phase.</p>

                                This work focuses on studying active/semi-active alternatives for crew seat impact attenuation systems for Indian manned space missions. Three configurations of impact attenuators are selected for the study, namely, hydraulic damper, hydro-pneumatic damper, and airbag system. The three systems are mathematically modeled, and their initial sizes are estimated by optimizing the plant. Furthermore, a control law is proposed for each of the configurations. The airbag impact attenuation system is studied in two configurations: stuck and unstuck. We have chosen Brinkley DRI (Direct Response Index), a NASA HSIR index on the risk of likelihood of spinal damage, as the cost function. The hydraulic damper reduced the Brinkley DRI by 36%, and the hydro-pneumatic damper reduced the DRI by 22% using semi-active control, whereas the airbag system reduced the DRI by 15%. The hydraulic dampers were proven to be superior to airbag and hydro-pneumatic systems within the spatial constraints imposed by the current crew module configuration.

                            <h3>Multi-disciplinary design optimization of small size expendable launch vehicle</h3>
                          <!--   <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Lead Researcher</p>-->

                               This work focuses on the optimal design of a small-scale Solid Rocket Motor (SRM)-based expendable Launch Vehicle (LV) for a 500 kg payload. In traditional methods, the subsystems are optimized individually and then iterate after the first design cycle, often leading to suboptimal global designs. To address this, I used Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) to simultaneously optimize subsystems with a global objective: minimizing Gross Lift-off Mass (GLOM). I coupled the 3-DoF trajectory and SRM burnback analysis using Multi-Disciplinary Feasible (MDF) architecture by creating a shared state space. I solved the problem as a Non-Linear Programming (NLP) problem using a hybrid optimization solver. The MDO approach achieved a 10% GLOM reduction compared to traditional methods, enhancing the payload-to-mass ratio. This study culminated in my internship thesis.
