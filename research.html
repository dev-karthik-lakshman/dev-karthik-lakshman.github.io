                <h2>My Research & Projects (My Funtime)</h2>
                <p>
                I have always been fascinated by modeling, designing, and controlling Dynamical Systems (DS) in the optimal way possible. I have been intrigued by the challenges: What if the dynamics of a system in an environment are not fully known? What if the DS is affected by uncertainties (the reason for most of the mission failures)? What if the DS is exposed to off-nominal conditions such as subsystem failures, extremely uncertain environments, etc.? Can we still stabilize the DS and reach the goal? If so, can we provide theoretical stabilities? To this end, I leveraged optimal control theory, data-driven modeling, optimization theory, and probability to answer a few of the above questions. Below, I discuss my research experiences.
